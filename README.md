# Blockchain Based RFID Authentication Comperisent

## Description

This project uses an RFID reader connected to a Raspberry Pi to encrypt data, and allows for the authentication of the data as a traditional web service or through the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.

The project is structured into three folders:

* `rfid`: Contains the Python code for the RFID reader on the Raspberry Pi.
* `blockchain`: Contains the Solidity code for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
* `web`: Contains the code for the traditional web service authentication.
## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository and navigate to the folder you want to use.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nebipeker/Blockchain-Based-RFID-Authentication-Comperisent.git
cd repo
cd [nfc, blockchain, or web]
```
## Usage

To use the RFID reader with Raspberry Pi, connect the reader to the Raspberry Pi and run the Python script in the `rfid` folder.

To use the blockchain authentication, deploy the Solidity code in the `blockchain` folder to an Ethereum node and interact with the smart contract.

To use the traditional web service authentication, run the code in the `web` folder on a server and access it through a web browser.
